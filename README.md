| Explore javascript in rails |
| Discover Turbolinks & Turbolinks Events |
| Organize javascript to only execute on specific pages |

**Terms:**
- Javascript Events
- Event Listener / Event Binding
- Turbolinks

## Instructions

This lab does not have a database! Just clone, bundle, and run `rails server`. Then launch the home page ("/") in your browser.

You should work exclusively in your javascript directory: `app/assets/javascripts/` unless otherwise noted.

#### Challenge 1: Color Changer

When you click on a color page, your background color should change to match the name of the color in your url path. Can you fix the current javascript? (Your homepage should _not_ be teal!)

- Does it work on refresh?
- Does it work when you click through to the page?
- Is your solution DRY?

<details><summary>Hint: How would you grab the _path_ for the current page from the URL bar? (Click Here)</summary>

```js
window.location.pathname
// or, just
location.pathname
```
</details>

<details><summary>Hint: How would you grab the _color_ for the current page from the path? (Click Here)</summary>

```js
location.pathname.split("/")[1]; // warning: returns "" if path is "/"!
```
</details>

#### Challenge 2: Page View Counter

The counter should increase for every individual page view.  Can you fix the current javascript?

- Do all the numbers reset when you refresh? (good!)
- Do specific numbers increment on each pageview?
- Is your solution DRY?

#### Challenge 3: Be More Specific
**Page Specific CSS**: Can you think of a way to get the desired "Color Changer" behavior (from Challenge #1), without using _any_ javascript? (For this challenge you should only modify `application.html` and any `css` files).

<details><summary>Hint: Namespace your CSS to only apply to certain pages.</summary>

Identify the current page using an html `class` attribute, an `erb` tag, and the name of the current controller:
```html
<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->
<body class="<%= page_specific_identifier %>">
    <!-- ... -->
</body>
```
<br/>
Reference the page specific `class` (i.e. the controller name and method name) in your stylesheet:
```css
/* app/assets/stylesheets/name_of_controller.css */
body.controller_name.method_name p {
    /*  
     *  the styles inside here will only apply to p tags
     *    that are nested inside body tags
     *      that have the "page_specific_identifier" id
     */
}
```
</details>

<br>
**Page Specific JS**: Create a pop-up that says "Welcome!" whenever a user lands on `/goldenrod` for the first time (but _not_ when they click through).

#### Bonus
**Remember Your Visitors**: Remember that a visitor has already been welcomed, and do not welcome them again!

<details><summary>Hint: Hmm, how would you remember that on the front-end? (Click Here)</summary>
